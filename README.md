## REST

[rest.bitcoin.com](https://rest.bitcoin.com) is the REST layer for Bitcoin.com's Cloud.

More info: [developer.bitcoin.com](https://developer.bitcoin.com). Chatroom [http://geni.us/CashDev](geni.us/CashDev)

Testnet available at [trest.bitcoin.com](https://trest.bitcoin.com)

## Usage

You can also run an instance of REST for your own full node.

### Prerequesites

#### NodeJS

Install nodejs's LTS. 8.11.4 at the time of writing.

https://nodejs.org/en/

### Full node

Fire up a full Bitcoin Cash node and add the following to your `bitcoin.conf`.

```
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
server=1

# Username for JSON-RPC connections
rpcuser=rpcUsername

# Password for JSON-RPC connections
rpcpassword=rpcPasssword

# If you're running REST on a different host than bitcoind's localhost
# rpcallowip=*
# Or you can restrict by IP or range of IPs
# rpcallowip=192.168.1.*

# Enable zeromq for real-time data
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://your.nodes.ip.address:28332
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://your.nodes.ip.address:28332
zmqpubhashtx=tcp://your.nodes.ip.address:28332
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://your.nodes.ip.address:28332
```

Also allow tcp requests on port `28332`

```
sudo ufw allow 28332
```

### Clone the repo

Next clone the rest.bitcoin.com repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/rest.bitcoin.com.git
```

#### Install dependencies

`cd` into the newly cloned directory and install the dependencies.

```
cd rest.bitcoin.com
npm install
```

#### Start REST

Now you need to start REST and pass in the following environment variables

* BITCOINCOM_BASEURL - On rest.bitcoin.com this env var is to our internal insight API. You can use insight's public API.
* RPC_BASEURL - The IP address of your full BCH node
* RPC_PASSWORD - The rpc password of your full BCH node
* RPC_USERNAME - The rpc username of your full BCH node
* ZEROMQ_PORT - The port on which you enabled ZeroMQ
* ZEROMQ_URL - The IP address of your full BCH node
* NETWORK - mainnet or testnet depending on which network you're using

Here's how the final command would look

```
BITCOINCOM_BASEURL=https://bch-insight.bitpay.com/api/ RPC_BASEURL=http://your.nodes.ip.address:8332/ RPC_PASSWORD=rpcPasssword RPC_USERNAME=rpcUsername ZEROMQ_PORT=28332 ZEROMQ_URL=your.nodes.ip.address NETWORK=mainnet npm run dev
```

#### View in browser

Finally open `http://localhost:3000/` and confirm you see the GUI
